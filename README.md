Polynomial regression

This is a sample model to just to know how a polynomial regression actually 
works and where we can use it and how to use it.

For this model i have used my own dataset for this i have created a polynomial dataset (which have some non linearity or curve in their trends)
To know what all are the functions that shows these kind trends I have used Desmos calculator ( https://www.desmos.com/calculator ) , here you can see the 
trends for different functions.

In the same way I found one function i.e tanh(x) , which was giving a non linearity patterns.

I have used numpy module to create the dataset for the model.

Modules used in this sample modeling are:
        Pandas
        Numpy
        SKlearn
        seaborn
        Matplotlib
